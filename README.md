# 3D_Crystal_DL

## Description

This page offers DL-driven tools for analyzing 3D charge density data. With this tool, users can accurately predict X-ray diffraction (XRD) results for 7 crystal systems, 101 extinction groups, and 230 space groups. In addition, regressions of bandgap energy and formation energy per atom done. This package simplifies crystallographic analysis for materials scientists.
 

## Software Requirements

The code is tested in under packages.

* OS : Ubuntu 22.04
* python : 3.8.16
* torch : 1.8.1
